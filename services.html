							<ul>
								<li><strong>Healing emotional wounds:</strong> Releasing stuck emotions and past traumas.</li>
								<li><strong>Deepening spiritual connection:</strong> Connecting with higher self, spirit guides, or universal energy.</li>
								<li><strong>Forgiveness and letting go:</strong> Releasing guilt, resentment, or attachments that block inner peace.</li>
								<li><strong>End-of-life healing:</strong> Easing fear of death and facilitating a peaceful transition.</li>
							</ul>
