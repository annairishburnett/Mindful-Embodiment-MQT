							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/jennifer-aldrich-headshot.webp" alt="headshot of Jennifer Aldrich-Boyle smiling in front of a rock wall" loading="lazy"/></span>Hello! I’m Jennifer Boyle, raised in beautiful Marquette, Michigan, surrounded by natural beauty. I’ve recently learned to appreciate my surroundings and reflect on my life and relationships, especially with my father, whose passing made me realize how little I knew him. This prompted me to seek growth and healing and pursue certifications in holistic wellness.</p>

							<p>I’m passionate about the mind-body-spirit connection and I believe that natural healing brings balance. All healing is self-healing. We all have the answers we need for our personal journey within us. Because we are all a part of the collective whole, we all have access to the infinite knowledge within, a universal life force that flows through all of us, connecting us to each other and the whole. You may know this infinite wisdom as God, the Holy Spirit, Krishna, chi, or prana- whatever you call it, we all have access to this beautiful state of being.</p>

							<p>Unfortunately, we often don’t know how to listen for the answers within. We have been conditioned to seek answers outside of us, therefore giving away our personal power. Once we learn how to access the answers we seek, we can choose to respond from a different place and find what resonates for us.</p>

							<p>As an Integrative Healing Arts Practitioner with a BS in Community Health Education, I create a compassionate space for self-empowerment and transformation. I believe we continue to grow throughout our lives in the Earthly realm. I would be honored to support you on your path, raising our vibrations and contributing to a collective shift.</p>

							<h4 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h4>
							<p>I aim to turn suffering into strength, foster personal growth, and continually enhance knowledge and compassion. We all have the ability to self-heal and the facility to learn how.</p>

							<p>I believe all healing is self-healing. I offer compassionate, non-judgmental space, as well as educational, spiritual, and emotional support to those who are seeking healing and growth within themselves.</p>

							<p>I believe in the accessibility of services to all.</p>

							<p> Above all, I believe in causing no harm to any being and helping to ease suffering and enhance joy.</p>


							<h4 id="subconscious">Subconscious</h4>
							<p>Our subconscious is where all of our long-term habits, conditioning, beliefs, and everything that ever happened to us are stored. When we access our subconscious, we reach those deeply stored, habitual ways we have been living, to more easily, effectively, and permanently create and apply the changes we want in our lives.</p>

							<p>There are many tools to help access the subconscious mind, including hypnotherapy. See our <a href="services.html#hypnotherapy">About Hypnotherapy</a> section to find out more about how hypnotherapy works.</p>

							<h4 id="tools">Tools</h4>
							<p>I offer an assortment of tools to aid in fostering self-love, change, and growth. We all need tools to help us navigate life in healthy and skillful ways. To do this effectively, it is helpful to find the tools that resonate with each individual person.</p>

							<p>Hypnotherapy is a tool that allows the client to connect with their subconscious to provoke deep and lasting changes.</p>


							<h4 id="why-you">Why you?</h4>
							<p>Are you in physical or emotional pain? Do you have a habit you want to discontinue? Do you feel disconnected from life or your personal path? Do you suffer from anxiety or self-limiting beliefs? Do you wish you could react differently in certain situations?</p>

							<p>If you feel debilitated by life and are ready to commit to creating change so you can live more authentically and joyfully, you are a good candidate for hypnotherapy.</p>

							<h4 id="why-me">Why Me?</h4>
							<p>I am deeply passionate about holistic wellness and the mind-body-spirit connection. I'm a firm believer in natural healing methods, the power of our ability to heal ourselves, and their ability to bring balance into our lives. I offer compassionate, non-judgmental space for supporting self-empowerment and growth.</p>

							<p>Through my own journey of self-healing, I have experienced many natural healing modalities. I found that I need to work with the tools that resonate with me. Not all tools will resonate with all people. The tools that I provide are tailored specifically to the individual, their focus, and what resonates for them.</p>

							<p>I look forward to growing alongside you!</p>

							<h4 id="stress">Perception of Stress</h4>
							<p>Everyday stress shouldn’t trigger the fight-or-flight response in our bodies, and in fact acute stress can even help us move out of danger, or grow and learn from an experience. Due to how we have learned to perceive stress and that we lack the skills to manage stressful thoughts or events, a staggering number of people are stuck in a chronic stress state, which over time damages the body.</p>

							<p>With a stress response, the body increases heart rate, and therefore blood pressure, and releases cortisol and adrenaline. This leads to shallow breathing, muscle tension, suppressed immune function, digestive issues, and chronic inflammation. Over time, these changes contribute to chronic health problems like heart disease, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders.</p>

							<p>Hypnotherapy brings relief to chronic stress by guiding the body and mind into a calm, peaceful state. This state brings a lowered heart rate and blood pressure, helping the cardiovascular system to recover from stress. It encourages deep, slow breaths that increase oxygen flow to the brain and body, encouraging the release of physical tension by easing tight muscles and reducing pain. It enhances immune function by allowing the body to focus on healing and calms the nervous system, helping to restore normal digestive function. Hypnotherapy teaches clients how to better manage stress triggers to remain calm and grounded in the face of challenges.</p>

							<h2 id="holistic-wellness">Holistic Wellness</h2>
							<p>Holistic wellness is an approach to health that considers the whole person—body, mind, and spirit. It recognizes that each aspect of an individual’s life is interconnected and that achieving optimal health requires addressing all these components.</p>

							<h4>Key Principles of Holistic Wellness</h4>
							<ol>
								<li><strong>Whole Person Approach:</strong> Health is not just the absence of illness; it encompasses physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being. If one of these is out of balance, everything will be out of balance.</li>
								<li><strong>Interconnectedness:</strong> Different aspects of wellness influence each other. For example, stress can impact physical health, while poor physical health can affect mental well-being. The energies I project will affect those around me and vice versa.</li>
								<li><strong>Personal Empowerment:</strong> Individuals are encouraged to take an active role in their health through self-awareness, education, and lifestyle choices. I also believe that self-love is the key to universal healing. As we grow and shift, we contribute to the overall consciousness. Working on bringing healing into our lives, as we can only change ourselves, we bring more love to ourselves and therefore bring more love to the whole - as the outside is a reflection of what is going on inside of us. As above, so below.</li>
								<li><strong>Natural Healing:</strong> Holistic wellness often emphasizes natural and preventive approaches to health, promoting self-care and lifestyle changes. We are powerful beings. Our thoughts and emotions behind the thoughts contribute to how we manifest in this life.</li>
							</ol>

							<p>Holistic wellness recognizes the complexity of human health and encourages a comprehensive approach to achieving balance and harmony. By incorporating alternative healing tools and incorporating mind-body-spirit healing, individuals can enhance their well-being and empower themselves to find growth and balance on their self-healing journey. Exploring these practices to find what resonates for you can lead to a more fulfilling, authentic, and joyful life.</p>

							<h4>What is Hypnosis?</h4>

							<p>Hypnosis is a focused state of awareness that allows individuals to tap into their subconscious mind. During hypnosis, a person may experience heightened suggestibility, relaxation, and increased concentration, making it easier to access thoughts and memories.</p>

							<p>Hypnotherapy is a holistic tool, using imagery and suggestions, to relax the conscious mind, teaches the clients how to access this peaceful state to ease both emotional and physical pain and respond to triggers more skillfully. Overall, integrating hypnotherapy into your life provides emotional, physical, and spiritual healing. This allows for more joy, authenticity, and acceptance in all aspects of life.</p>

							<p>Hypnotherapy sessions can be conducted in person or virtually, making this powerful tool accessible regardless of location. Hypnotherapy offers relief with a variety of symptoms and habits, including but not limited to:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Reducing anxiety and fear</li>
								<li>Releasing attachments and stored emotions</li>
								<li>Enhancing emotional wellbeing</li>
								<li>Improving sleep, physical comfort, and pain management</li>
								<li>Deepening connection to others, self, and Spirit</li>
							</ul>

							<p>Additional tools that may be integrated with hypnotherapy sessions include: <em>mindfulness and present moment awareness, cultivating gratitude, mind-body awareness, guided imagery, breathing techniques, tapping (EFT), aromatherapy, spiritual and emotional support, and ceremony and blessings.</em></p>

							<p><strong>*The process of hypnotherapy</strong>(This does not include the information gathering pre-hypnosis).
							</p>


							<p>Hypnosis involves several key stages:</p>
							<ol>
								<li><strong>Induction:</strong> The process begins with a series of techniques designed to relax the individual and focus their attention. This can include guided imagery, deep breathing, or progressive muscle relaxation.</li>
								<li><strong>Deepening and visualization:</strong> Once relaxed, the hypnotist helps the individual enter a deeper state of hypnosis, enhancing their receptiveness to suggestions.</li>
								<li><strong>Suggestion:</strong> In this state, the hypnotist provides positive suggestions or imagery to address specific issues.</li>
								<li><strong>Post-Hypnotic Suggestions:</strong> The individual may receive suggestions intended to take effect after the session, helping them notice triggers and change behaviors or thought patterns.</li>
								<li><strong>Awakening:</strong> The session concludes with the hypnotist guiding the individual back to full awareness.</li>
							</ol>

							<p>*To impart real change through hypnosis, a couple of conditions need to be met. <strong>One</strong>, the client needs to deeply desire and be committed to the change. <strong>Second</strong>, there needs to be repetition! The practitioner practices repetition during the hypnosis session. The client continues repeating affirmations and suggestions after the hypnosis session. The client repeats hypnosis by scheduling follow-up hypnotherapy sessions to create lasting changes. It takes years to create the conditions we want to bring change to, so it stands to reason it may take longer than one session to create the change we want.</p>
