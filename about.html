							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/jennifer-aldrich-headshot.webp" alt="headshot of Jennifer Aldrich-Boyle smiling in front of a rock wall" loading="lazy"/></span>Hello! I’m Jennifer Boyle, raised in beautiful Marquette, Michigan, surrounded by nature. I’ve recently learned to appreciate my surroundings and reflect on my life and relationships, especially with my father, whose passing made me realize how little I knew him.</p>

							<p>This prompted me to seek growth and healing and pursue certifications in holistic wellness.</p>

							<p>I’m passionate about the mind-body-spirit connection and I believe that natural healing brings balance. All healing is self-healing. We all have the answers we need for our personal journey within us. Because we are all a part of the collective whole, we all have access to the infinite knowledge within, a universal life force that flows through all of us, connecting us to each other and the whole. You may know this infinite wisdom as God, the Holy Spirit, Krishna, chi, or prana- whatever you call it, we all have access to this beautiful state of being.</p>

							<p>Unfortunately, we often don’t know how to listen for the answers within. We have been conditioned to seek answers outside of us, therefore giving away our personal power. Once we learn how to access the answers we seek, we can choose to respond from a different place and find what resonates for us.</p>

							<p>As an Integrative Healing Arts Practitioner with a BS in Community Health Education, I create a compassionate space for self-empowerment and transformation. I believe we continue to grow throughout our lives in the Earthly realm. I would be honored to support you on your path, raising our vibrations and contributing to a collective shift.</p>

							<h4 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h4>
							<p>I aim to turn suffering into strength, foster personal growth, and continually enhance knowledge and compassion. We all have the ability to self-heal and the facility to learn how.</p>

							<p>I believe all healing is self-healing. I offer compassionate, non-judgmental space, as well as educational, spiritual, and emotional support to all who are seeking healing and growth.</p>

							<p>I believe in the accessibility of services to all.</p>

							<p> Above all, I believe in causing no harm to any being and helping to ease suffering and enhance joy.</p>


							<h4 id="subconscious">Subconscious</h4>
							<p>Our subconscious is where all of our long-term habits and beliefs are stored, therefore our subconscious needs to be “activated” to reach those deeply stored, conditioned ways we live. We can then implement the changes we want to make through repetition, suggestion, and affirmations.</p>

							<p>There are many tools to help access the subconscious mind, including hypnotherapy. See our <a href="services.html#hypnotherapy">About Hypnotherapy</a> section to find out more about how hypnotherapy works.</p>

							<h4 id="tools">Tools</h4>
							<p>There are many tools to aid in fostering self-love, change, and growth. It is important to find ones that resonate with you. Tools that access the subconscious mind, such as hypnosis and meditation bring deeper and lasting changes.</p>

							<p>Hypnotherapy is a tool that allows the client to connect with their subconscious to provoke deep and lasting changes. Other tools I provide include spiritual and transpersonal coaching, guided relaxation and imagery, mind-body awareness, present moment awareness, cultivating gratitude, tapping, aromatherapy, neuro-linguistic programming, releasing and cleansing of stagnant energies, mantras and affirmations, ceremony and blessings.</p>


							<h4 id="why-you">Why you?</h4>
							<p>Are you in physical or emotional pain? Do you have a habit you want to discontinue? Do you feel disconnected from life or your personal path? Do you suffer from anxiety or self-limiting beliefs? Do you wish you could react differently in certain situations?</p>
							<p>If you feel debilitated by life and are ready to commit to creating change so you can live more authentically and joyfully, you are a good candidate for hypnotherapy.</p>
							<p>Hypnotherapy offers relief in all those areas and more. Together you and the hypnotherapist can decide on the focus of the sessions and begin to create a personalized plan of action to begin imparting the changes you wish to see and feel in your life.</p>


							<h4 id="why-me">Why Me?</h4>
							<p>I am deeply passionate about holistic wellness and the mind-body-spirit connection. I'm a firm believer in natural healing methods, the power of our ability to heal ourselves, and their ability to bring balance into our lives.</p>
							<p>Armed with a BS in Community Health Education, a diploma for Integrative Healing Arts Practitioner, and certifications in Transpersonal Hypnotherapy and Transpersonal and Spiritual coaching, I offer compassionate, non-judgmental space for supporting self-empowerment and growth.</p>
							<p>Through my own journey of self-healing, I have experienced many natural healing modalities. I found that I need to work with the tools that resonate with me. Not all tools will resonate with all people. The tools that I provide are tailored specifically to the individual, their focus, and what resonates for them.</p>
							<p>I look forward to growing alongside you!</p>

							<h4 id="stress">Perception of Stress</h4>
							<p>Everyday stress shouldn’t trigger the fight-or-flight response, but due to how we perceive stress (as explained in The Upside of Stress), many of us are stuck in this chronic state. Worrying about everyday issues, such as bills, food, housing, and work, and feeling like we can’t deal with it, keeps us in fight-or-flight mode, which over time damages the body.</p>

							<p>When stressed, the body increases heart rate, blood pressure, and releases cortisol and adrenaline. This leads to shallow breathing, muscle tension, suppressed immune function, digestive issues, and chronic inflammation. Over time, these changes contribute to chronic health problems like heart disease, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders.</p>

							<p>Hypnotherapy brings relief to chronic stress by guiding the body and mind into a calm, peaceful state. Hypnosis lowers heart rate and blood pressure, helping the cardiovascular system to recover from stress; encourages deep, slow breaths that increase oxygen flow to the brain and body; encourages the release of physical tension, easing tight muscles and reducing pain; enhances immune function by allowing the body to focus on healing; calms the nervous system, helping to restore normal digestive function. Clients learn how to better manage stress triggers, remaining calm and grounded in the face of challenges.</p>

							<h2 id="holistic-wellness">Holistic Wellness</h2>
							<p>Holistic wellness is an approach to health that considers the whole person—body, mind, and spirit. It recognizes that each aspect of an individual’s life is interconnected and that achieving optimal health requires addressing all these components. This philosophy emphasizes balance and harmony in various areas, including physical, emotional, social, spiritual, and environmental well-being.</p>

							<h4>Key Principles of Holistic Wellness</h4>
							<ol>
								<li><strong>Whole Person Approach:</strong> Health is not just the absence of illness; it encompasses physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being. If one of these is out of balance, everything will be out of balance.</li>
								<li><strong>Interconnectedness:</strong> Different aspects of wellness influence each other. For example, stress can impact physical health, while poor physical health can affect mental well-being. The energies I project will affect those around me and vice versa.</li>
								<li><strong>Personal Empowerment:</strong> Individuals are encouraged to take an active role in their health through self-awareness, education, and lifestyle choices. I also believe that self-love is the key to universal healing. As we grow and shift we contribute to the overall consciousness. Working on bringing healing into our lives, as we can only change ourselves, we bring more love to ourselves and therefore bring more love to the whole- as the outside is a reflection of what is going on inside of us. As above, so below.</li>
								<li><strong>Natural Healing:</strong> Holistic wellness often emphasizes natural and preventive approaches to health, promoting self-care and lifestyle changes. We are powerful beings. Our thoughts and emotions behind the thoughts contribute to how we manifest in this life.</li>
							</ol>

							<p>Holistic wellness recognizes the complexity of human health and encourages a comprehensive approach to achieving balance and harmony. By incorporating alternative healing tools and incorporating mind-body-spirit healing, individuals can enhance their well-being and empower themselves to find growth and balance on their self-healing journey. Exploring these practices to find what resonates for you can lead to a more fulfilling, authentic, and joyful life.</p>

							<h2 id="hypnotherapy">Hypnotherapy</h2>
							<h4>What is Hypnosis?</h4>
							<p>Hypnosis is a focused state of awareness that allows individuals to tap into their subconscious mind. During hypnosis, a person may experience heightened suggestibility, relaxation, and increased concentration, making it easier to access thoughts and memories.</p>

							<div class="box">
								<p><strong>The trance state in hypnosis dissociates the conscious and the unconscious. This allows us to surpass the barriers of consciousness, making it easier to access the hidden potential that we all possess. By creating a dissociative state, the subject distances themselves from their ego and conditioning. This allows us to access the space where all habits, patterns, perceptions, and conditioning are stored. This provides an opportunity for new habits and beliefs to be put in place, creating deep and lasting changes in your life.</strong></p>
							</div>

							<h4>The Benefits of Hypnosis</h4>

							<p>In our lives, we often lack the tools to communicate authentically with loved ones about critical issues and experiences, including death—an inevitable part of life. This lack of communication can lead to unprocessed emotions that get stuck inside us, creating blocks to our well-being. Many people are not taught that experiencing and expressing emotions is essential for living a healthy life, both physically and emotionally.</p>

							<p>Stuck emotions can contribute to chronic health issues. Our bodies signal distress, but we often focus solely on symptoms, neglecting the underlying emotional causes. Hypnosis offers a powerful method to bypass the conscious mind, allowing us to work through these emotional blocks.</p>

							<p>One crucial aspect of this work involves forgiveness—both seeking and granting it, from self and others. Many individuals carry hidden guilt from perceived wrongdoings, which can lead to prolonged suffering in life and as they face death. Releasing resentment is vital, as these emotions can fester and affect our well-being. The wisdom of Buddha reminds us that holding onto anger is like holding onto a hot coal, which only harms ourselves, making it essential to let it go to achieve inner peace.</p>

							<p>Unprocessed emotions can drain vital energy, which may be particularly essential in the later stages of life. As clients release these emotions, they often gain clarity about what they need to communicate and prioritize at this present time. With clients facing the end of life, this may include letting go of attachments to earthly possessions or relationships which can create obstacles to a peaceful departure.</p>

							<p>Spiritual connections are shown to be a huge factor in how we perceive the quality of our lives and in how we look at death and dying. This may be even more pivotal for individuals nearing the end of life. Hypnotherapy can help deepen these connections, addressing spiritual concerns that may arise, regardless of one's personal beliefs. For some, this exploration becomes urgent as they confront their mortality. Additionally, involving family members in this process can be beneficial, enabling them to find closure and support each other in processing grief.</p>

							<p>Hypnotherapy, using imagery and suggestions, teaches clients to relax into acceptance, easing both emotional and physical pain. Overall, integrating hypnotherapy into your life provides emotional, physical, and spiritual healing. This allows for more joy, authenticity, and acceptance in all aspects of life.</p>

							<p>Hypnotherapy sessions can be conducted in person or virtually, making this powerful tool accessible regardless of location. Hypnotherapy offers relief with a variety of symptoms and habits, including but not limited to:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Reducing anxiety and fear</li>
								<li>Releasing attachments and stored emotions</li>
								<li>Enhancing emotional wellbeing</li>
								<li>Improving sleep, physical comfort, and pain management</li>
								<li>Deepening connection to others, self, and Spirit</li>
							</ul>

							<p>Additional tools that may be integrated with hypnotherapy sessions include: <em>mindfulness and present moment awareness, cultivating gratitude, mind-body awareness, guided imagery, breathing techniques, tapping (EFT), aromatherapy, spiritual and emotional support, and ceremony and blessings.</em></p>

							<p><strong>*The process of hypnotherapy</strong>(This does not include the information gathering pre-hypnosis)
							</p>


							<p>Hypnosis involves several key stages:</p>
							<ol>
								<li><strong>Induction:</strong> The process begins with a series of techniques designed to relax the individual and focus their attention. This can include guided imagery, deep breathing, or progressive muscle relaxation.</li>
								<li><strong>Deepening:</strong> Once relaxed, the hypnotist helps the individual enter a deeper state of hypnosis, enhancing their receptiveness to suggestions.</li>
								<li><strong>Suggestion:</strong> In this state, the hypnotist provides positive suggestions or imagery to address specific issues.</li>
								<li><strong>Post-Hypnotic Suggestions:</strong> The individual may receive suggestions intended to take effect after the session, helping them notice triggers and change behaviors or thought patterns.</li>
								<li><strong>Awakening:</strong> The session concludes with the hypnotist guiding the individual back to full awareness.</li>
							</ol>

							<p>*To impart real change through hypnosis a couple of conditions need to be met. One, the client needs to deeply desire and be committed to the change. Second, there needs to be repetition! The practitioner practices repetition during the hypnosis session. The client continues repeating affirmations and suggestions after the hypnosis session. The client repeats hypnosis by scheduling follow-up hypnotherapy sessions to create lasting changes. It takes years to create the conditions we want to bring change to, so it stands to reason it may take longer than one session to create the change we want.</p>
